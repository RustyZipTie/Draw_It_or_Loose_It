# Draw_It_or_Loose_It

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?  
  The client, Gaming Room, is a game development company currently working on their latest game, Draw It or Loose It. The game involved players working in teams to guess words based off of images. While the client already had a version of the game finished and deployed as an Android app, they wished to expand to a web application, and potentially other platforms. For this, they required assistance setting up a cloud-based server to store images and user info, as well as tracking games and allowing users to play with each other remotely.
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  My analysis of the domain model covered all the points, and explained how the principles of OOP were in play in this context.
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The requirements were the most helpful part. For instance, the reqirement for unique usernames helped me create an instantiation method for users that checks for duplicate names.
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would go into more detail in my evaluations of different operating systems.
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The requirements listed in the design document made the user's needs pretty clear, and once I had that, I only needed to translate these needs into code, as in the username unqiquness example above. As an organization that takes contracts to build software for other organizations, it is critical to make software that conforms to the user's needs as much as possible, and to be honest with the client when it is not possible. Disappointed clients will probably contract us again, and could damage our reputation.
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Instead of immediately diving into the coding portion of the work, I took a couple of minutes to make sure I understood how the software was structured and how the different classes interacted with each other. This helped a lot, although I did end up missing a few details, so in the future I could benefit from checking my work more thouroughly.
